glusterfs test automation framework
==============================================

This is a glusterfs test automation framework written in python. The framework
is written with portability in mind. This just needs bunch of ip addresses or
resolvable hostnames. The ip address may be of the bare metal machine, vm or
even docker container.

How to run
=============

1. scp gluster_utils/server_rpycd /usr/local/bin to each of your server nodes.

2. scp gluster_libs/rcscript_server_rpycd to /etc/init.d/server_rpycd to all
   of your servers/nodes.

3. Start the server using /etc/init.d/server_rpycd start

4. Run the following commands in each of your machines.
   chkconfig server_rpycd --add
   chkconfig server_rpycd on

5. Source the config.sh file which has information about test environment.

6. Now run main.py with proper options
   - To run only test case
     # python main.py -t 123456

   - To run bunch of test cases
     # python main.py -t "12345 06783"

   - To run all tests in a directory
     # python main.py -d snapshot


How to write tests
====================

1. Create a directory inside ./tests_d with your component name.
   The name should qualify to be a python variable which can be importable
   from other modules.

2. Write a testcase using the test_*.py

3. For test skeleton and example please look at the
   example/snapshot/test_basic_snapshot.py
